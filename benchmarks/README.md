Functionals used in the benchmarks should have the method unspecified, unless
you are making a benchmark for a specific method / implementation.
One of the objectives of the benchmarks is to select the best method for the
functionals that works on wide range of cases in a reasonable amount of time
(i.e. robustness over speed).
